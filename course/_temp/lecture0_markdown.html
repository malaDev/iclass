<h1>Lecture 0</h1>

<p>Introduction to principles of software engineering for mobile devices and best practices, including code reviews, source control, and unit tests. Topics include Ajax, encapsulation, event handling, HTTP, memory management, MVC, object-oriented design, and user experience. Languages include HTML5, JavaScript, Objective-C, and PHP. Projects include mobile web apps and native iOS apps.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> Students are encouraged, but not required, to have a Mac (running Lion) as well as an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch; students without a Mac will have access to Macs in labs on campus. Students will work on projects in pairs; students are encouraged to enroll with a friend. Enrollment may be limited. May be omitted in 2012-2013.</p>

<p>Prerequisite: Computer Science 50 or equivalent.</p>

<h2>Voorbereiding</h2>

<p>Als je nog niet over de juiste voorkennis beschikt doe je eerst &eacute;&eacute;n of meer van deze problem sets uit de cursus CS50:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mispellings (voor een razendsnelle inleiding tot C en datastructuren)</li>
	<li>C$50 Finance (over HTML, PHP en MySQL)</li>
	<li>CS50 Shuttle (helemaal over Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>

<p>You are expected to attend all lectures and labs and to meet, with the same partner for each, five milestones for each of four projects.</p>

<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>

<p>A student must ordinarily meet all milestones in order to be eligible for a passing grade (i.e., A to D-) unless granted an exception in writing by one of the course’s heads.</p>

<p>Each project’s proposal, design doc, style guide, and code reviews are evaluated primarily along axes of clarity and thoroughness. Each project’s beta is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, design, and style. Each project’s release is evaluated primarily along axes of scope, correctness, design, and style. Axes’ weights may vary by project.</p>

<p>The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. Scores on projects’ milestones may be normalized across graders at term’s end. Each student’s final grade is individually determined after input from the teaching fellows. Prior experience, remarkable effort, and upward trending may be considered.</p>

<p>Partners ordinarily receive the same letter grade at term’s end, except in cases where one partner’s contributions to projects fall short of expectations.</p>

<h2 id="website">Website</h2>

<p>Visit the course’s website to watch videos, to get help, to download handouts and software, and to follow links to other resources.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>No books are required for this course, but the below are among those recommended by the staff. Realize that free, if not superior, resources can be found on the course’s website.</p>

<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>

<p>Recordings from the Harvard lectures will be posted somewhere between Monday and Wednesday each week.</p>

<h2 id="problemsets">Problem Sets</h2>

<p>Our course starts with two problem sets to get you up to speed. <strong>You need to choose two of them, depending on your experience.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You need to submit your first problem set by 12 February</li>
	<li>You need to submit your second problem set by 19 February</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to <a href="http://cs50.tv/2011/fall/">http://cs50.tv/2011/fall/</a> for more information about the problem sets. There, you can also download the lecture notes for each lecture. They are very well-written, so you can use them to quickly review the lecture contents.</p>

<p>So, how do you get started?</p>

<ul>
	<li>optionally; watch the lectures regarding HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript</li>
	<li>read the problem set description and make sure you understand it</li>
	<li>start preparations, download the code framework and read it</li>
	<li>watch the walkthrough, which will guide you through the first steps</li>
	<li>code and debug your solution</li>
	<li>submit!</li>
</ul>

<p>For the problem sets, you need to install the <strong>CS50 appliance</strong>. Use version 2.3 per the instructions on <a href="https://manual.cs50.net/CS50_Appliance_2.3">manual.cs50.net</a>.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>There are four projects in this course. We will start with two HTML5 mobile apps: one specified by the staff, and one freely chosen by yourself (pending staff approval). After that, you will be creating two <em>native</em> apps using the iOS platform SDK.</p>

<p>A schedule of deadlines for projects’ milestones, subject to change, appears below. It will be amended a little to account for holidays and such.</p>

<h3 id="webappstaffschoice">Web App (Staff&#8217;s Choice)</h3>

<h3 id="webappstudentschoice">Web App (Student&#8217;s Choice)</h3>

<h3 id="nativeappstaffschoice">Native App (Staff&#8217;s Choice)</h3>

<h3 id="nativeappstudentschoice">Native App (Student&#8217;s Choice)</h3>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>

<p>Lectures are supplemented each week by 2-hour labs led by the teaching fellows. Labs provide you with opportunities to experiment hands-on with tools and techniques as well as with opportunities for counsel on projects’ design and implementation.</p>

<p>We will watch the lab videos together.</p>

<h2 id="academichonesty">Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course’s expectations must be the work of you and your partner. Collaboration with anyone other than the partner with whom you begin the semester is not permitted unless one of the course’s heads approves a change of partner in writing. Partners must contribute equitably to each milestone: you may not implement most or all of some project’s milestone and submit it on behalf of your two-person team.</p>

<p>Viewing or copying another individual’s work (even if left by a printer, stored in an executable directory, or otherwise exposed) or lifting material from a book, website, or other source—even in part—and presenting it as your own constitutes academic dishonesty, as does showing or giving your work, even in part, to another student or soliciting the work of another individual. Similarly is dual submission academic dishonesty: you may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available solutions to projects to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. Moreover, submission of any work that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) must be approved by the staff.</p>

<p>You may read and comment upon classmates’ code toward fulfillment of projects’ code reviews but only for classmates whose code is assigned to you by the course’s staff for review. You may integrate ideas and techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates’ code and from classmates’ reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your own code. As for classmates beyond your own partner and those with whom you’re involved in reviews, you may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share code. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English, but you may not communicate in PHP, JavaScript, or Objective-C. If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course’s heads.</p>

<p>You may turn to the Web for instruction beyond the course’s lectures and labs, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to projects or portions thereof. However, failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you do discover outside of the course’s lectures and labs (even while respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be considered academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers some matter to the Administrative Board and the outcome for some student is Admonish, Probation, Requirement to Withdraw, or Recommendation to Dismiss, the course reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.</p>
